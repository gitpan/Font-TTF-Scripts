=head1 INTRODUCTION

This module contains various scripts using the Font::TTF module. 

Any suggestions, improvements, additions, subclasses, etc. would be gratefully
received and probably included in a future release. Please send them to me.

This module has been tested on Win32, Unix and Mac.

=head1 INSTALLATION

If you have received this package as part of an Activestate PPM style .zip file
then type

    ppm install Font-TTF.ppd

Otherwise.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following.

    perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install Font::TTF somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

You need the following dependencies installed:
Algorithm::Diff
IO::String
Text::PDF
XML::Parser
Unicode::String
Text::Unicode::Equivalents

(On Debian/Ubuntu the corresponding packages to install are:
libalgorithm-diff-perl
libio-string-perl
libtext-pdf-perl
libxml-parser-perl
libunicode-string-perl
libtext-unicode-equivalents-perl)

Then to build you run make.

    make

If you have write access to the perl library directories, you may then
install by typing:

    make install

(sudo make install on Ubuntu)

To tidy up, type:

    make realclean

Win32 users should use pmake instead of make. Alternatively installation can be
done on Win32 by typing:

    Setup

Or using the install feature in tools like WinZip.
