=head1 TITLE

make_volt - Create VOLT code from a TrueType Font

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  make_volt [-a file] [-l ligtype] [-i file] [-n] infile outfile
  make_volt -t [-a file] [-l ligtype] [-i file] [-n] infile

Creates a copy of the infile font file adding a VOLT table to it.

=head1 OPTIONS

  -a file       Attachment Point database .xml file
  -f            force new lookups even if same named exist
  -h            print manpage
  -i fontfile   merge VOLT table from this font or text file
  -l type       type =
                    first - class name is first code, contents other codes
                    last  - class name is last code, contents other codes
                    firstcomp - treat extensions as part of elements, as first
                    lastcomp - treat extensons as part of elements, as last
  -m "list"     List of anchors that do not imply a MARK glyph (e.g. "_R")
  -n            Don't generate lookups
  -t            output volt code to stdout and don't generate a font file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

make_volt aims to make the creation of OpenType fonts much easier. It allows
for a font designer to make changes and to feed that changed font forward
to merge previously created VOLT code without losing that work. It also creates
glyph names, key classes and lookups that can save a lot of work in VOLT.

In addition, make_volt has the capability to merge the volt code it creates
with existing volt code either in a font or in a text file.

=head2 Glyph naming

Glyphs are named based on the postscript name of the glyph with variants and
illegal characters stripped from the name. Name clashes are simply numbered.

=head2 Classes

make_volt creates a number of different kind of class. For each attachment
point base name (I<x>) a class is created. Class C<c>I<x>C<Dia>
contains a list of all the glyphs with the attachment point C<_>I<x>. Class
C<cTakes>I<x>C<Dia> contains all the glyphs with attachment point I<x>. Class
C<cn>I<x>C<Dia> contains all the glyphs without attachment point C<_>I<X>. And
the class C<cnTakes>I<x>C<Dia> contains all the glyphs without the I<x>
attachment point.

In addition for each glyph name variant (as labelled in a postscript name for
a glyh using C<.>I<var>) a class named C<c>I<var> is created with all the glyphs
with that variant in their name. A class named C<c_no>I<var> is also created
containing all the corresponding glyphs without the variant, in direct
correspondance, so that the non-variant form may be mapped to the variant
form using a single rule, for all the glyphs in the class.

Finally a class is created for ligature components. If a glyph is part of a
ligature rule it is either the key glyph for the rule or part of the class
for the rule. Thus for a rule keyed of a glyph named I<x> there will be two
classese: C<cl_>I<x> which is the ligatures involving I<x> and C<clno_>I<x>
which contains all the components that correspond to the ligatures found in
the other class. This makes a ligature rule a simple 1:1 mapping from
C<clno_>I<x> to C<cl_>I<x>.

=head2 Ligatures

make_volt has the ability to create ligature mapping lookups. These are controlled
by glyph names and follow the approach taken in C<make_gdl>.
