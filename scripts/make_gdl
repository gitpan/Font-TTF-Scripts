  -h            print manpage
  -i file       add #include statement at end of file
  -l type       type =
                    first - class name is first code, contents other codes

  -s num        Add ligature substitution rules with the given pass number
  -z bitfield   Bitfield of various controls:
                    0 - use component properties to set ligature bounding boxes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When writing a GDL description for a font there are generally two parts to
such a description. The first part is a general behaviour description that is
appropriate to a number of fonts for a particular writing system. It will
contain rules for reordering, substitution, positioning, etc and is often
written in terms of classes rather than individual glyphs. For a very simple
script such a description may be empty.

The second part of a description is font specific and includes names of glyphs
positions of attachment points and other properties for each glyph. It will
also contain class definitions and perhaps even some glyph specific rules.

It is this second part that make_gdl is designed to address. Make_gdl will
take a TTF and perhaps an attachment point database (defined in ttfbuilder)
and will create a standardised font specific GDL description which may or
may not be sufficient to describe the behaviour of the font. It is more
likely that a general behaviour file will also need to be written.

The generated GDL consists of 4 sections:

=head2 Glyph Definitions

Each glyph has a definition as part of a C<table(glyph)> section. The name of
the glyph is based on the postscript name of the glyph. If the name is of
the form of a general Unicode character in the Adobe Glyph List, then the
name is transformed with an initial C<g_> followed by the unicode USV. If
there is a sequence of unicode values in the name, the C<uni> parts of the
name are replaced by <_> resulting in something like: C<g_1000_103c>.
Otherwise the name is transformed to lower case with each upper case letter
preceded by C<_> and the name preceded by C<g_> as in C<g__a> for A. If
a glyph has a variant (C<.>I<var>) the C<.> is turned into C<_>. If a glyph
is multinamed (separated by C</>) then only the first name is used for the
glyph name although the glyph will appear in all the classes appropriate to
all its names.

Glyphs may have attachment points and these come from the attachment points
database given on the command line. In addition any properties with the name
starting C<GDL_> are included as glyph attributes for use in rules. Ligature
components may also propagate from the attachment point database.

Attachment points are assumed to be named according to the Fontlab convention
whereby a diacritic has an anchor named C<_>I<x> that is anchored to a base
character on the attachment point I<x>. The names of the se attachment points
are munged so that C<_>I<x> becomes C<xM> and I<x> becomes I<x>C<S>.

=head2 Class Definitions

For each attachment point base name (I<x>) a class is created. Class C<c>I<x>C<Dia>
contains a list of all the glyphs with the attachment point C<_>I<x>. Class
C<cTakes>I<x>C<Dia> contains all the glyphs with attachment point I<x>. Class
C<cn>I<x>C<Dia> contains all the glyphs without attachment point C<_>I<X>. And
the class C<cnTakes>I<x>C<Dia> contains all the glyphs without the I<x>
attachment point.

In addition for each glyph name variant (as labelled in a postscript name for
a glyh using C<.>I<var>) a class named C<c>I<var> is created with all the glyphs
with that variant in their name. A class named C<c_no>I<var> is also created
containing all the corresponding glyphs without the variant, in direct
correspondance, so that the non-variant form may be mapped to the variant
form using a single rule, for all the glyphs in the class.

Finally a class is created for ligature components. If a glyph is part of a
ligature rule it is either the key glyph for the rule or part of the class
for the rule. Thus for a rule keyed of a glyph named I<x> there will be two
classese: C<cl_>I<x> which is the ligatures involving I<x> and C<clno_>I<x>
which contains all the components that correspond to the ligatures found in
the other class. This makes a ligature rule a simple 1:1 mapping from
C<clno_>I<x> to C<cl_>I<x>.

=head2 Rules

Make_gdl may also create generalised rules to simplify the creation of GDL
descriptions. Which rule sets are generated is controlled from the command line.

If the C<-n> command line option is used, make_gdl will create normalisation
rules. These rules will map any glyph sequence that corresponds to a unicode
sequence that has a canonical composition that exists in the font into that
glyph.

If the C<-s> command line option is used, make_gdl will write rules for combining
glyphs into ligatures according to the glyph naming in the postscript name table.
Ligature rules are based on a class and a glyph. By default the class contains a
list of first glyphs in a ligature pair and there is a rule for each second glyph.
If C<-l last> is used then this is reversed with there being a rule for each first
glyph and the second glyph is in a class. If variants are involved, should
the name be a variant of the ligature or the last glyph in the ligature sequence?
If C<-l firstcomp> or C<-l lastcomp> then then variant is considered part of the
last glyph otherwise it is considered part of the ligature.

=head2 Inclusion

make_gdl outputs a preprocessor definition C<MAXGLYPH> that is set to the number
of glyphs in the font.

Since a GDL description is only a single file, the command line allows one to
specify another GDL file to include at the end of the file. This makes including
a font independent GDL fragment much easier.
