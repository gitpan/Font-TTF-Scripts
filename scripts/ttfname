=head1 TITLE

ttfname - renames font files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ttfname [-f "full_name"] -n "name" [-t num] [-q] infile.ttf outfile.ttf
Renames the TTF with the given name and outputs the newly named font to
out.ttf.

=head1 OPTIONS

  -f "name"   specifies new full name (optional) as opposed to the
              default calculated form.
  -l lang     language number to use (default all langs)
              if specified name entries will be added for all platforms and
                  encodings covered by the cmap if not already there
  -n "name"   specifies new font family name (not optional)
  -p          Don't update postscript font name
  -q          disable signon message
  -r num      Removes all strings of the given ids. Space- or comma-separated
              ids or id ranges (denoted by "..") may be specified.
  -s filename overrides -n and gets string from file. Useful for -t
  -t num      overrides the normal naming areas to change another
              string -f becomes inactive. Use -l as well to create entry.
  -w "name"   overrides subfamily in the font (think weight). So a full name
              may be made from -n and -w together.
